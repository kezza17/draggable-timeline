** What I want this to do **

- Basic functionality

  * show a grid
  * show items in the grid
  * move items in the grid
  * resize items in the grid
  * remove item from the grid

- restrictions

  * no going outside of the grid when dragging
  * no going outside of the grid when resizing
  * no overlapping of items

- togglable functionality

  * specify resize directions
  * specify drag directions
  * specify max item size (height or width)
  * click to create
  * drag to create
  * default size on create

- other functionality \*

* make grid a calendar
* switch between calendar modes
* select item to get data
* snap to grid or free move with shadow/preview

- issues so far

* can't use validateDrag to stop dragging over edges etc
* move items on scroll with grid
